"Plexxi","Like most good ideas, it began with a frustration over the status quo. Networks were too complex, too costly and too inefficient.

Dave’s eureka moment came when reading Microsoft’s paper on traffic patterns, understanding that network congestion was a result of inefficient conversations taking place within its infrastructure. So, he created an SDN controller to understand and direct these conversations. However, Dave soon realized that the dynamic software could only work with underlying hardware that would also change on the fly. Thus, the Plexxi Switch was born, using photonic switching technologies to bring an adaptable capacity to a previously static environment.","","Rick Barry,Jamie Goldstein","","Rick Barry","","No","","https://angel.co/rick-barry,https://angel.co/jamie-goldstein","","https://angel.co/rick-barry","","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

We are introducing a number of firsts into an age old space - from the fit data we collect to the algorithm to the better bras we manufacture as a result.

We create a deeply personal shopping experience - each customer sees a lingerie shop specifically selected for her based on her fit data. Our proprietary algorithm recommends and sells only the styles and sizes (yes plural!) that fit a woman&#x27;s specific body shape.

"Jetlore","Product relevance in email marketing, web product feeds, and mobile product feeds is responsible for more than 50% of B2C e-commerce revenue. User signals are often fragmented across different channels: email, mobile, web, search, social. It’s hard to interpret and integrate these signals into centralized user profiles for merchandise targeting and relevance in a coherent manner across time.

Jetlore is an automated marketing platform that semantically auto-tags merchandise and processes user data from a variety of channels building up centralized purchase taste profiles of the users and leveraging these profiles to target users with relevant offers. 

We&#x27;re working with some of the largest online retailers and have demonstrated to them up to 2x conversion lifts substantially boosting their revenue and raising customer engagement and satisfaction.","Eldar Sadikov,Montse Medina,Sergey Andreev","George Zachary,Matt Ocko,Elliot Loh,N Shivakumar,Clint Korver,Stewart Alsop,Anis Uzzaman,Eddy Lee,Bo Fishback,Sharmila Shahani-Mulligan,Javier Torremocha,Wayne Pan,Jeff Morris Jr.,Kibo Ventures,Barbod Namini","","Elliot Loh,Hector Garcia-Molina","","Yes","https://angel.co/eldar-sadikov,https://angel.co/montsechka,https://angel.co/sergey-andreev","https://angel.co/georgezachary,https://angel.co/mattocko,https://angel.co/elliotloh,https://angel.co/shivakumar-n,https://angel.co/ckorver,https://angel.co/stewart-alsop,https://angel.co/anis-uzzaman-ph-d,https://angel.co/eddylee,https://angel.co/bofishback,https://angel.co/sharmila-shahani-mulligan,https://angel.co/torremochaj,https://angel.co/waynep,https://angel.co/jmj,https://angel.co/kibo-ventures,https://angel.co/barbod-namini","","https://angel.co/elliotloh,https://angel.co/hector-garcia-molina","",""

"Sqrl","Sqrl makes collecting information from clients completely painless.

Accountants and other professional service providers spend as much as 25% of their time requesting and following up on the information they need to perform their work. Sqrl eliminates the wasted time by providing a web application to create, track, auto-remind, and gather requests from individuals or large groups of people in as little as one click.

Sqrl sends requests through e-mail, not a portal. Clients and recipients have nothing to download, log into, or adopt – they simply respond in a basic webform, and Sqrl ingests, interprets, and alerts the sender when the request is satisfied. Files collected by Sqrl are
automatically synced to the user’s cloud storage account. Sqrl also delivers critical analytics to the sender about their clients, enabling them to gather information faster and make strategic pricing and business decisions.","Ryan Watson,Craig Baldwin,Ryan Baker","Ira Weiss,Trevor Wright","Zack Brown","Tony Alexander","","Yes","https://angel.co/ryan-watson-cpa,https://angel.co/craig-baldwin-1,https://angel.co/ryan-baker","https://angel.co/ira-weiss,https://angel.co/trevor-wright","https://angel.co/zack-brown","https://angel.co/tony-alexander","","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

"Prompt.ly","Prompt.ly is the only mobile-first, scheduling, promotion and payment platform for soloprenuers, who in the US alone account for over 1 trillion dollars of economic activity each year. 

Solopreneurs (including chiropractors, tutors, psychologists, wedding photographers, personal trainers, and babysitters to name a few) use the platform to improve scheduling, promotion &amp; payments. Prompt.ly allows soloprenuers to instantly market available time to existing clients &amp; their friends via social promotion — while clients reduce the pain of scheduling and gain access to discounts for recommending their soloprenuers. 

The platform is mobile-first like the soloprenuers themselves, integrating the key features they need to run their business entirely on-the-go. Prompt.ly finally brings modern technology to the Invisible Economy.","Richard D.

"Seamless Toy Company","Our first product, ATOMS, is a system of plug-n-play sensors, motors, and action blocks for kids (and anyone) to add interactive functionality to their creations. ATOMS are fun, fast and don&#x27;t require any electronics or programming skills to get going.

ATOMS work seamlessly with LEGO and other toys, can be sewn or velcro-ed onto fabrics, or bolted onto more permanent creations.

ATOMS work with iOS devices (Android soon), so users can control their ATOMS from their iPhone/iPod/iPad, and can also inversely control their iPhone from ATOMS.

ATOMS are sold through starter sets that show kids what each ATOM does through already-popular play experiences (imaginary characters and kid-scale play). However, we expect kids&#x27; interest in ATOMS to outlast the starter-set themes, as they go onto use ATOMS in their own creations.

ATOMS can also be bought individually for the &quot;from-scratch&quot; project doer, and we will be releasing a new ATOM every month to serve our enthusiastic repeat customers.","Michael Rosenblatt","Mike Collett,Chris Byrne,Alap Shah,Sunwoo Hwang,Peter Thorne","Starr Million Baker APR,Jay Hamlin","Brad Schell","","Yes","https://angel.co/michael-rosenblatt","https://angel.co/mlcollett,https://angel.co/chrisbyrne,https://angel.co/alap-a-shah,https://angel.co/sunwoohwang,https://angel.co/peter-thorne","https://angel.co/starr-million-baker-apr,https://angel.co/jay-hamlin","https://angel.co/brad-schell","",""

Everything about us—our fresh designs, our pricing, our mission to empower women, our short lead times, and our distribution and supply chain—is challenging the status quo in an industry that hasn’t changed much since the 1970’s. 

We are the first lingerie brand to offer a fast fashion supply chain while doing social good. And we are optimizing inefficient supply chains to offer higher quality and higher fashion goods at a fraction of existing market costs. For consumers this means that we make better products, really fast, at a better price, with fun branding while maintaining very high gross margins.

We analyze people&#x27;s iTunes library, their Open Graph (if they log in with Facebook), and continuously build playlists of thousands of radio stations from around the world. We match those and give users a shortlist of recommendations. Given that stations regularly change their content, the nature of the recommendations is dynamic, and will change every day.

On the B2B side, we are building a self-service dashboard that gives stations usage metrics: real-time listener count, historic usage, aggregated music profiles of listeners, demographics.

Monetization will happen through premium user features and a premium business intelligence offering for radio stations.

Medium term, we will branch out from pure music and add schedules with sports, talk, shows and more. Eventually, through the digital platform, we will connect stations with their listeners.","Rahul Powar,Christian","","","","","Yes","https://angel.co/rahul-powar,https://angel.co/christianmiccio","","","","",""

"Rethink Robotics","At Rethink Robotics, we believe that all manufacturers, regardless of size and technology experience, should have an equal opportunity to benefit from production robots. They should be affordable. They should be safe to operate around people. They should be easy to train and work right out of the box. And most of all, they should help U.S. manufacturers increase production while keeping jobs from migrating overseas.

We also believe that educational and corporate research teams, who are leading the way in developing tomorrow’s Next Big Thing, should have easy and affordable access to a robotic innovation platform that can help their visions become reality.

Rethink Robotics is a new kind of robotics company, and our mission is to bring safer, more affordable, and yes, friendlier robotics technologies to people who have little to no access to them today.

Simply put, we are rethinking robotics. And we think you will, too.","","Tim Draper,Alex Taussig","","","","No","","https://angel.co/timdraper,https://angel.co/ataussig","","","","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

"908 Devices","Mass spectrometry is a well-established analytical technique used in virtually every chemical analysis laboratory for limitless applications from safety &amp; security, to food science, biotechnology, clinical diagnostics and controlling industrial processes.  Conventional laboratory mass spectrometry setups are designed to accommodate a wide variety of often-disparate needs, but unfortunately this flexibility leads to complexity. And complex systems are large, expensive, and tricky to operate and maintain.

We are building ridiculously small, and elegantly simple purpose-built products based on remarkable mass spectrometry technology. These systems are designed for specific applications in security, biotechnology, diagnostics and others, bringing MS capability from the centralized lab to the point of need.","","Nicholas Pann","","","","No","","https://angel.co/nicholas-pann","","","","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

"Trustev","Trustev’s real time, identity engine separates out the real customers from the fraudsters ensuring that online merchants know exactly who they are transacting with.

Trustev uses multiple, dynamic data sources to independently verify a user’s identity to enable online merchants to be certain of exactly who they are doing business with. Our technology works by positively identifying customers in advance of accepting payments to minimise the cost of reviewing orders and eliminate fraudulent transactions.Trustev’s passive authentication technologies work in the background of the transaction confirming and securing the transaction, while their active authentication technologies work to confirm the user’s identity before payment is made. Part of this solution is our much talked about; ‘Social Fingerprinting’ technology, that with the permission of the user, uses available social data to further verify their identity to a merchant.","Pat Phelan,Chris Kennedy","Kamran Ansari,Kevin Abosch,Eamon Leonard,David Coallier","Pat Phelan,Chris Kennedy,DC Cahalane,Alexia Golez,Diarmuid Thoma,Jason Ryan,John Peavoy,Niall Chandler,Jonathan Bowers,Stephen Fanning,David Devane","Anil Hansjee,Kevin Abosch,Eamon Leonard,David Coallier,Dylan Collins","","Yes","https://angel.co/patphelan,https://angel.co/chris-kennedy","https://angel.co/kansari,https://angel.co/kevin-abosch,https://angel.co/eamonleonard,https://angel.co/davidcoallier","https://angel.co/patphelan,https://angel.co/chris-kennedy,https://angel.co/dc_cahalane,https://angel.co/lexia,https://angel.co/diarmuidthoma,https://angel.co/jason-ryan-1,https://angel.co/johnpeavoy,https://angel.co/niallchandler,https://angel.co/jonathan-bowers,https://angel.co/stephen-fanning,https://angel.co/david-devane","https://angel.co/anil-hansjee,https://angel.co/kevin-abosch,https://angel.co/eamonleonard,https://angel.co/davidcoallier,https://angel.co/dylan-collins1","","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

"Paidpiper","Paidpiper has taken the complexity out of credit card payments systems by working with the Payments Industry and made it available to everyone via the smartphone network. But we did not stop there. Next we applied smartphone intelligence to our platform turning each user (smartphone node as we like to call it) into a highly secure control point to ensure that your money is used safely and the way you want.

Think of it this way, we all belong to a micro-network, some are small like our family and some are large like followers of popular brands. In either case our platform allows you to send or receive money with individuals in your selected network with the precision, control and real time monitoring in a usable format. Working with the Payments leaders we have robust security and redemption that does not require additional hardware or software at Point of Purchase.","Atif Hussein","Ryan T.

"Accredible","Accredible makes all learning, skills or expertise credible on your CV, regardless of where or how they were obtained. By shifting the emphasis away from where you learned something towards what you learned, any learning can be credible, whether it happened inside a school, on a MOOC or in the library. We re-imagine the idea of the diploma to be more than just a name, grade &amp; institution, but a living portfolio of evidence that you have certain knowledge or skills. By attaching all the work that went into a course onto the diploma itself, its credibility can be derived from the learning itself, giving a better image of who a student is and what they can do.

"Kareo","Kareo was founded by our CEO, Dan Rodrigues, in 2004 with a vision of simplifying medical offices with web-based medical billing software that replaces the expensive and complex medical billing and practice management systems doctors have today. We have since created the most user-friendly, easy-to-buy, and easy-to-setup software on the market.

Our technology-spirited approach disrupted the status quo for medical billing software. We were one of the very first companies to eliminate enormous licensing fees and we introduced a fresh new way of doing business without the legal handcuffs of multi-year contracts. We committed to earning the business of our customers every month and giving them the freedom to stop using Kareo if their needs changed.","","Travis Kalanick,Ron Palmeri,Daniel Killeen,Rob Reid","Rob Pickell,Jonathan O&#x27;Rourke,Jason Leu,John LaMarche","","","Yes","","https://angel.co/konatbone,https://angel.co/ronp,https://angel.co/daniel-killeen,https://angel.co/rob-reid","https://angel.co/rob-pickell,https://angel.co/jonathan-o-rourke,https://angel.co/jason-leu,https://angel.co/john-lamarche","","","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

"Sales Portal","Sales Portal solves long-standing pain points for two large industries:
1. Call Centers struggle to monetize their existing call traffic - current monetization technique (cross-selling) is ineffective and onerous.
2. Advertisers highly value inbound phone leads - conversion rates are 10X higher for phone calls compared to clicks. However traditional phone lead gen (TV, radio, etc) is on CPM basis, offering Advertisers no performance guarantees.

Our auction-based platform enables call centers to monetize their call traffic by pitching relevant products at the end of calls. Bidding advertisers receive warm-transfer leads on a pay-per-call basis.

"Bozza","AFRICA&#x27;s LANDSCAPE 
- With approximately 60% of Africans under age 25; a deep culture of music and storytelling; and broad-scale, rising economic prosperity, young Africans represent one of the most promising consumer markets for entertainment today
- The size of the formal Film, Music and Television industry across just Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa is estimated at over $4bill

NEED
- To Africans, African content is not global; it’s local
- Poets, musicians and filmmakers are poised to meet this demand for local but have no way to access the market
- Africa’s share of the global creative economy is less than 1%, proving that while talent is universal, opportunities are not 

SOLUTION
- Bozza allows for any musician, filmmaker, poet across Africa the ability to self publish (including digital merchandising)
- Currently Bozza covers over 3000 mobile devices, desktops and next year a free-to-air satellite TV station
- Bozza is the marketplace for the next generation of African talent","Emma Kaye","","Wayne Powell,Nanziwe Mzuzu,Alan Munro,Karen Liebenberg,Andrew Maunder,Thembisa Mpefu,Nicole Klassen","Raj Gollamudi","","Yes","https://angel.co/emma-kaye","","https://angel.co/wayne-powell,https://angel.co/nanziwe-mzuzu,https://angel.co/alan-munro-735,https://angel.co/karen-liebenberg,https://angel.co/andrew-maunder,https://angel.co/thembisa-mpefu,https://angel.co/nicole-klassen","https://angel.co/raj-gollamudi","",""

"Swiftype","Search makes the Internet work.

Google’s most valuable product (Web search) drives the majority of their revenue. Today each percentage of Web query volume is worth between $500M (1% of bing @ 30% market share) and $5B (1% Google @ 60% market share). Naturally the market is evolving. This flavor of search technology can’t be everything to everyone, and often doesn’t suit other Web apps, services, deep sites, stores and enterprise. Mobile apps in particular, are looking for ways to have a search experience similar to what exists on the Web but that access their stores directly.

We built Swiftype to provide search as a service — for websites and mobile applications. 

We offer a free plan for a basic customizable search engine, and scale up to Enterprise accounts.  Revenue comes from a monthly service plan. A Professional Account costs ~$600/month. Our business model is pretty similar to other business-critical SaaS models like Dropbox or Salesforce.","Quinlan Hoxie,Matt Riley","Paul Buchheit,Alexis Ohanian,Tikhon Bernstam,Harj Taggar,Prashant Malik,Garry Tan,Chris Howard,Felix Shpilman,Matt Ocko,Jared Kopf,Kevin Moore,Tom Fallows,Amos Elliston,Jared Friedman,Jon Nathanson,Patrick S.

"Just Sing It","Singing voice - a critical contributor to the rise of micro-content sharing that we believe has been overlooked in the US yet has seen phenomenal initial success in Asia.

Just Sing It - designed initially as a mobile music game - turns into a music community and discovery platform, where users sing and share their favorite songs on FB/Twitter, apply voice filters to ‘Instagram their voice’ and guess songs with others &amp; even potential love interests. 

Users have also been using Just Sing It to serenade and ultimately flirt. With the majority of users being women, men are demanding better ways to display their interest in ladies’ talents via virtual gifts, short messages or performance enhancements.

In 2 weeks since launch, 500,000 songs were sung on the platform, more than 80,000 installs with a 5 star App store rating and an average of 5.6 songs per session, proving the singing is a truly sticky phenomenon in the US.

The market is child savings - $1.3 trillion saved.
The competition is 529 plans - only 3% of families are using them because they are complicated.
Everyone else is using regular checking and savings accounts with zero interest because they can never get the $3000 minimums to open an account.

TrustEgg is a trust company and we make complex financial products simple.

We launched in February and have seen pretty amazing traction with almost zero marketing budget.  See the numbers below.   

Originally a YCombinator company, Foresight Ventures, the founders and Angel investors have been funding the company through this stage.  We are seeking an additional $400k to continue to test various marketing channels and partnerships.","John Zdanowski,Jeff Brice","Felix Shpilman,David Vivero,Howard Love,John Zdanowski,Andrey Kazakov,Joshua B Siegel,Andrew Romans,Christophe Fraise,Glenn Fratangelo,Georgetown Angels,Todd French","Damon Bruce","Paul Bragiel,Chris Yeh,TK Kuegler,Gabe Krambs,Eric Genrich","John Zdanowski,Jeff Brice","Yes","https://angel.co/john-zdanowski,https://angel.co/jeff-brice","https://angel.co/nxrfelix,https://angel.co/davidvivero,https://angel.co/howard-love,https://angel.co/john-zdanowski,https://angel.co/andrey_kazakov,https://angel.co/joshua-b-siegel,https://angel.co/andrew-romans-1,https://angel.co/cfraise,https://angel.co/glenn-fratangelo,https://angel.co/georgetown-angels,https://angel.co/todd-french","https://angel.co/damon-bruce","https://angel.co/bragiel,https://angel.co/chrisyeh,https://angel.co/tom-tk-kuegler,https://angel.co/gabekrambs,https://angel.co/ecgenrich","https://angel.co/john-zdanowski,https://angel.co/jeff-brice","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

"Wantering","Wantering is a better way to search, discover, and shop online. We start by mapping the inventory of the web, so we know whatʼs for sale, how much it costs, and what size and colours are available. We then bubble up the hottest items using over 100mm social signals from sites like Polyvore, Pinterest, Svpply, and Tumblr.

This data gives Wantering the unique ability to power shopping across the web. Our first property is a powerful search engine specially tuned to the needs of the fashion shopper. For example, we can support queries like ʻFloral Prada shirts under $200ʼ and come up with relevant results.

Weʼre also creating ways for 3rd parties to use our data. For example, we have developed a tool that helps blogs and magazines detect when products they are linking to go out-of-stock and present their readers with similar items instead. Tools like this can both drive affiliate revenue and acquire new users.","Matt Friesen,Nicholas Molnar,Nick Cairns","Ted Rheingold,Paul Kedrosky,Eric Norlin,Mike Edwards,Michael Mahon,BDC VC Strategic Investments &amp; Initiatives,Max Teitelbaum,Initio Group,Eric Bukovinsky, CFA,Mike Satterfield,Michael Volker,Paul Antoniadis","Peter Cellik,Kathleen Ong,Woojun Chang,Gerald Cruz,Cody Young","Ted Rheingold,Rick Webb,Boris Wertz,Ryan Holmes,Max Teitelbaum","","Yes","https://angel.co/mattfriesen,https://angel.co/nicholasmolnar,https://angel.co/niccai","https://angel.co/trheingold,https://angel.co/pkedrosky,https://angel.co/eric-norlin,https://angel.co/marallo,https://angel.co/mikejmahon,https://angel.co/bdc-vc-strategic-investments-initiatives,https://angel.co/max-teitelbaum,https://angel.co/initio-group,https://angel.co/eric_yaletown,https://angel.co/mike-satterfield,https://angel.co/michael-volker,https://angel.co/paul-antoniadis","https://angel.co/peter-cellik,https://angel.co/kathleen-ong,https://angel.co/woojun-chang,https://angel.co/cruzpresso,https://angel.co/cody-young","https://angel.co/trheingold,https://angel.co/rickwebb,https://angel.co/bwertz,https://angel.co/ryan-holmes,https://angel.co/max-teitelbaum","","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

"CROICE","Croice is developing a platform for bloggers to create and share interactive audio streams to attract and engage audience.

Bloggers are always out looking for ways to engage and keep the readers.

Well, audio is the next big thing to do all of the above.
According to respected agencies such as KPCB and Arbitron Research, audio sharing is starting to take over photo and video sharing, which is proved by rapid growth of online radio stations and their listeners. The number of active listeners is 87 mil per week in the US alone, and this number is doubling every 4 years.

Up to this moment bloggers had no way to utilize this trend. Podcasts and classical online radio stations are difficult to share, non-interactive, and overall not that efficient.

Croice helps audio to be dynamic and fun, and be easily accessible to blogger&#x27;s audiences.","Vadim Zhernov","","","","","Yes","https://angel.co/vadim-zhernov","","","","","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

Our technology solves the data integration problems that developers face on a daily basis. Datadipity is a tool that structures all data into an app-ready JSON and XML API that is compatible with any front-end library. It can be installed on any commodity hardware or cloud server infrastructure. It does not require code to integrate or mash data and API mappings can be saved and reused for new projects.

There is currently no product on the market like this. We are the first and the most advanced implementation of API delivery. We can convert any Web API or Device API into our generic API format.

"EasyPost","EasyPost is a simple shipping API for developers. Now developers can add shipping from the US Postal Service, FedEx, UPS, and DHL into their apps in minutes. We believe that verifying addresses, checking rates, purchasing postage, and tracking packages should be as easy as possible. No one should ever have to endure multi-month integrations, deal with multiple shipping providers, or use APIs designed when SOAP was all the rage.

EasyPost is changing the way shipping works. Every day, tens of thousands of EasyPost packages are delivered across the world.  We are saving developers countless hours of development and millions of dollars of shipping costs.  This is just the beginning of the beginning.","Jarrett Streebin","MG Siegler,David Lee,Dalton Caldwell,Adrian Aoun,Ullas Naik,Andrew Montgomery,Jacob Brody,Charlie Songhurst,Mark Patricof,Shawn Bercuson,Alan Chang,Rahul Vohra,Lars Kamp,Kevin Barenblat,Patrick Gallagher,Jody Glidden,Walker Williams,Sean Byrnes","Thomas Schiavone,Andy Bakun,Sawyer Bateman","Ben Lewis,Michael Seibel","","Yes","https://angel.co/jarrett-streebin","https://angel.co/parislemon,https://angel.co/daslee,https://angel.co/daltonc,https://angel.co/adrian-aoun,https://angel.co/ullas-naik,https://angel.co/andrew-william-montgomery,https://angel.co/jacob-brody,https://angel.co/charlie-songhurst,https://angel.co/mark-patricof,https://angel.co/sbercuson,https://angel.co/alan-chang,https://angel.co/rahulvohra,https://angel.co/lars,https://angel.co/kevin-barenblat,https://angel.co/pgallagher,https://angel.co/jody-glidden,https://angel.co/walker-williams,https://angel.co/sean-byrnes","https://angel.co/thomas-schiavone,https://angel.co/thwarted,https://angel.co/sawyer","https://angel.co/ben-lewis,https://angel.co/michael-seibel","","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

"DataXu","DataXu was founded by MIT aeronautics and astronautics scientists who wrote the combinatorial language that guided NASA’s Mars mission plans. These scientists – joined by co-founders with extensive digital media and consumer electronics expertise – examined potential commercial applications that would benefit from a system that could make real-time decisions. They knew that a huge opportunity existed in marketing, being disrupted by the consumer digital lifestyle and big data, but still operating with manual solutions based on intuition, as well as an inefficient supply chain.

The founding team recruited the smartest people they knew to create DataXu as it is today – an open, neutral platform that enables marketers to use our ‘rocket science‘ in a simple UI to understand and engage consumers in a digital world. We are proud to have created the industry’s first and only real-time multi-variate decision system to bring science to the art of marketing.","Mike Baker,Ed Crawley","Jeff Fagnan,Andrew Tweed,Kuo-Yi Lim,Greg Stuart,Jeff Bussgang,John Hadl,Vineet Mehta,Matt Witheiler,Hal Shear,Tom Rutledge","Mark Jung,Evan York,Brian Mascarenhas","","","Yes","https://angel.co/mike-baker,https://angel.co/ed-crawley","https://angel.co/jfagnan,https://angel.co/andrew-tweed,https://angel.co/limky,https://angel.co/greg-stuart,https://angel.co/jeff-bussgang,https://angel.co/john-hadl,https://angel.co/vineet-mehta,https://angel.co/witheiler,https://angel.co/hal-shear,https://angel.co/tom-rutledge","https://angel.co/mark-jung,https://angel.co/evan-york,https://angel.co/brian-mascarenhas","","","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

Cloud Architects, Application Developers and their IT organizations can now manage access controls across cloud applications from a single dashboard.  Move beyond tracking just “people”; track identity of VMs, jobs, processes, system accounts, services, apps, etc. Manage identity continuously through complex request cycles and connections to diverse back-end services. Create access policies in business defined terms. Enforce access control via REST APIs, intelligent proxy servers, LDAP, and platform integrations. Enforce limits on privileged code, e.g. automation and configuration.

Unlike other  products, Conjur removes the burden and costs of engineering for multiple APIs, services, and systems software to provide complete and integrated identity, access, auditing, and management.

"Estimize","Estimize is an open financial estimates platform which facilitates the aggregation of fundamental estimates from independent, buy-side, and sell-side analysts, along with those of private investors and students. By sourcing estimates from a diverse community of individuals, Estimize provides both a more accurate and more representative view of expectations compared to sell side only data sets which suffer from several severe biases.

Over 3,500 analysts contribute to Estimize out of a registered user base of more than 20,000, resulting in coverage on over 900 stocks each quarter. The Estimize consensus has proven more accurate than comparable sell side data sets over 65% of the time.

The firm was founded in 2011 by former quantitative hedge fund analyst Leigh Drogen, with the belief that the financial ecosystem was ready for an estimates platform built with an open and transparent philosophy.

Estimize data is now available on major financial research platforms such as Bloomberg.","Leigh Drogen","Jim Savage,Nana Wilberforce PhD,Songhua Hu,Bob Greene,Charles Deutsch,Todd Sullivan,Michael Bigger,Contour Ventures,Joshua Maher,Robert Ross,Longworth Venture Partners,Kush Patel,Lucien Foster,Conor Sen,Jacob Carlson,Joel Mesznik","Leigh Drogen,Greg Neufeld,Ilya Scharrenbroich,Cynthia Koo,Brian Smith,Josh Dulberger,Amanda Mazzella,Kevin Havas,Jesse Youngmann,Adam Patten","Greg Neufeld,Robert Ross,Billy Libby,Matt Wallaert,Josh Elwell,Karl Antle,Wayne Mulligan,Vinesh Jha","Bob Greene,Leigh Drogen","Yes","https://angel.co/ldrogen","https://angel.co/jim-savage,https://angel.co/nana-wilberforce-ph-d,https://angel.co/songhua-hu,https://angel.co/bob-greene,https://angel.co/charles-deutsch,https://angel.co/todd-sullivan,https://angel.co/michael-bigger,https://angel.co/contour-ventures,https://angel.co/joshua-maher,https://angel.co/robross,https://angel.co/longworth-venture-partners,https://angel.co/kush-patel-96930,https://angel.co/lucien-foster,https://angel.co/conor-sen,https://angel.co/jacob-carlson,https://angel.co/joel-mesznik","https://angel.co/ldrogen,https://angel.co/gregneuf,https://angel.co/ilya-scharrenbroich,https://angel.co/cynthia-koo,https://angel.co/lytol,https://angel.co/jidulberger,https://angel.co/amanda-mazzella,https://angel.co/kevinhavas,https://angel.co/jesse-youngmann,https://angel.co/adam-patten","https://angel.co/gregneuf,https://angel.co/robross,https://angel.co/william-libby,https://angel.co/mattwallaert,https://angel.co/jelwell,https://angel.co/karlantle,https://angel.co/wayne-mulligan,https://angel.co/vinesh-jha","https://angel.co/bob-greene,https://angel.co/ldrogen","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

"Spinzo","Spinzo is a demand-based pricing platform that allows businesses to sell products, services, or tickets, where the final price depends on the number of committed buyers. It is useful for retailers (clearance sales, new product promotions) and sports teams (flexible pricing to maximize seat demand). Spinzo creates a multiplier effect on ad dollars since customers actively share with friends to get more savings. The platform is hosted by Spinzo but white labeled to the branding of the partner business. The company was established in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada in 2011 and is funded by GrowthWorks Atlantic, New Brunswick Innovation Foundation, East Valley Ventures, and other private investors.

"Foodee","Foodee is for offices ordering group meals from great local restaurants.

We have 300+ corporate customers ordering through Foodee. Our customer segment is high LTV, average order size is $275, and most customers order regularly (in some cases several times daily). 

We have 30+ curated restaurants that offices can not order from directly as they do not deliver. Our best restaurant partners earn an additional $4K-$8K/month from Foodee.

"ePACT Network","ePACT is the emergency network, allowing families and organizations to connect, share critical information and communicate via web and mobile in any crisis. 

As a &#x27;LinkedIn for emergencies&#x27;, ePACT is free for families, acting as their single emergency record and support network in one. Families can securely store their critical information, then connect and share it with friends, relatives and organizations who support them.

Organizations pay a small per member annual license fee to connect, share information and communicate with their members anytime, anywhere, no matter the crisis. ePACT is the emergency preparedness and response standard, replacing antiquated systems with online processes that directly address existing gaps and liabilities, ultimately helping to save lives.

Whether dealing with a personal injury, community-wide flood or safety issue, or large-scale disaster like an earthquake, ePACT provides greater connectivity and safety for all.","Kirsten Koppang Telford,Christine Sommers","Debbie Landa,Jim Fletcher","David Rossellat","","","Yes","https://angel.co/kirsten-koppang-telford,https://angel.co/christine-sommers","https://angel.co/deblanda,https://angel.co/jim-fletcher","https://angel.co/david-rossellat","","","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

"7 Cups of Tea","7 Cups of Tea is a marketplace for emotional support. People contact us when they need to talk to somebody. If you are struggling and need to talk, then you have two options: family/friends or therapy. Family may judge you, not understand you, or simply not be the best listeners. Therapy, on the other hand, can be intimidating, costly and inconvenient. 7 Cups of Tea is in the middle. We match you up with trained active listeners that have passed a background check, a screening interview w/a mental health professional, and an advanced course in active listening. Active listeners are kind, compassionate and non-judgmental. 

The key insight that this business is built on is that most people do not need full on psychotherapy and a diagnosis, they just need someone to listen.

For users, the site is anonymous, convenient, affordable and on-demand. We take a 40% cut of all transactions. 

We solve a core human problem. People need somebody to talk to. They need someone to listen.","Glen Moriarty","Paul Buchheit,Charlie Cheever,Alexis Ohanian,Dalton Caldwell,Garry Tan,Oliver Jung,Matt Huang,Justin Sullivan,Jonathan Ehrlich,Nir Eyal,Zachary Townsend,Alex Polvi,Sid Murlidhar","Marla Schuchman,Cris Firman","Sid Murlidhar","","Yes","https://angel.co/glenmoriarty","https://angel.co/buchheit,https://angel.co/ccheever,https://angel.co/alexisohanian,https://angel.co/daltonc,https://angel.co/garrytan,https://angel.co/oliver-jung,https://angel.co/matthuang,https://angel.co/justintsullivan,https://angel.co/jonathan-ehrlich,https://angel.co/nireyal,https://angel.co/zachary-townsend,https://angel.co/alex-polvi,https://angel.co/sid-2","https://angel.co/marla_s,https://angel.co/cris-firman","https://angel.co/sid-2","",""

"Angaza Design","Angaza offers a complete Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) solution to distributors of “pico-scale” energy products in the off-grid world. Our PAYG technology allows consumers to purchase solar lamps and mobile phone chargers over time, in affordable increments, just like they purchase cellular airtime. By removing the upfront price barrier to solar products, we enable our distribution partners to sell to the entire market of energy consumers in emerging economies, vastly expanding their sales and reach. Our PAYG hardware adds minimal cost to a solar product, making integration an attractive option for solar lantern manufacturers.","Victoria Arch,Lesley Marincola,Bryan Silverthorn","Julie Chin,Steven Grimm,Karen Linder,Michal Kopec,Linseed Capital,Don Weil,Kiki Tidwell, Tidwell Idaho Foundation,karen kaushansky","Fiona Mati","Enrique Allen,Christina A.

Fueled by technological advances spanning biochemistry, microfabrication, optics, and high-performance systems design, DNA sequencing is advancing at an unprecedented rate of approximately 10-fold improvement in cost and throughput every 18 months. As a result, data output and compute requirements have vastly outstripped Moore&#x27;s law, shifting the bottleneck toward the data management challenges. Soon it will be possible to sequence a full human genome for well under $1,000, making sequencing the first million genomes commercially viable, but will require compute infrastructure on the order of 100,000 CPUs and Exabytes of storage.","","Rob Hayes,Aydin Senkut,Manu Kumar,Claremont Creek Ventures,Krishna Yeshwant","Fahd Butt,Anna Lau","","","Yes","","https://angel.co/robhayes,https://angel.co/asenkut,https://angel.co/manukumar,https://angel.co/claremont-creek-ventures,https://angel.co/krishna-yeshwant","https://angel.co/fahdoo,https://angel.co/anna-8","","","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

"ZoeMob","ZoeMob is a Safety Service for parents which helps them to take care of their kids and track their daily activities when they aren’t close. More than 6 million of parents, over 180 countries, use ZoeMob to:

- Track kids’ check-in/out on schools, home, gym, club, etc.
- Get notified if they are over speeding
- Know if they are texting inappropriate messages for their age
- Locate them
- Keep an eye on who they are talking to
- Private messaging

By analyzing the pattern of user mobility and communications (texting/calls) through its algorithms, ZoeMob can predict its activities and alert if there is any unexpected behavior, or make suggestions based on their habits.

Just like social applications ZoeMob can build a social and place graph. The major difference is: all the connections are build using real life data, based on the handset usage, not based only on “online interactions”.","Daniel Aviz\u00fa,Helio Freitas","Grupo RBS,Cassio Spina","","Nelson Mattos","Cassio Spina","Yes","https://angel.co/davizu,https://angel.co/helio-freitas","https://angel.co/grupo-rbs,https://angel.co/cassio-spina","","https://angel.co/nelson-mattos","https://angel.co/cassio-spina",""

"Quarterly","We&#x27;re a subscription service with a twist: instead of signing up for a brand, Quarterly users subscribe to an influential person or celebrity they admire, who personally curates mailings 4 times/year. Each mailing also arrives with an letter from the contributor, and a hashtag (e.g. #TIM03) to guide the conversation online.

We feature roughly 40 contributors in a range of fields—Pharrell Williams, Tim Ferriss, and Heather &quot;Dooce&quot; Armstrong are all Quarterly contributors—and are rapidly expanding that roster. Our hope is that anyone browsing our site will find a contributor (or several) who speaks to their interests. The site also has strong gift sales.

Quarterly combines the pleasures of an unplugged, offline experience (when is the last time you got a care package?) with the connectivity of social media (now, you can share tweets and photos of that package with fellow subscribers around the world).

Days answers the question “what did you do today?&quot; and bridges the gap between status updates (which are easy to create but rarely interesting or coherent in aggregate–Facebook Timeline) and anthologies (which have lasting value, but require more effort and forward-thinking than most people can muster–1 Second Everyday).

"Affirmed Networks","Today, Mobile Data is at a crossroads where the industry must primarily meet the challenges of the present, but also be cognizant of future opportunities. An evolutionary solution can address both sets of drivers and requirements. Affirmed Networks was formed by a team of industry veterans with this philosophy in mind. Mobile data as a business is growing significantly and while it creates a great opportunity for mobile Operators, it presents its unique set of challenges. 

Operators must simultaneously provide for rapidly growing data usage, create advanced application services demanded by increasingly sophisticated users, and apply user-specific treatments to deliver the best quality of experience. And if that isn’t enough, the mobile Operator also has the unique challenge of monetizing the distribution of content and forming symbiotic and mutually collaborative relationships with content providers and advertisers.","","Michael Horowitz","","","Jon Auerbach","No","","https://angel.co/mahorowitz","","","https://angel.co/jgauerbach","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

Prescription eyewear simply should not cost $300+. The industry is controlled by a few large companies that have kept prices artificially high, reaping huge profits from consumers who have no other options. By circumventing traditional channels and engaging with customers directly through our website, Warby Parker is able to provide higher-quality, better-looking prescription eyewear at a fraction of the price.

We meticulously crafted our first collection of 27 limited run styles, plus one monocle, using the finest custom acetates and materials. The Warby Parker aesthetic is vintage-inspired with a contemporary twist. Every pair is custom fit with anti-reflective, polycarbonate prescription lenses.

Available exclusively through our website and showrooms, our glasses start at $95.","Andrew Hunt,Dave Gilboa","Chris Dixon,Chris Hollod,Nils Johnson,Scott Belsky,Troy Carter,Kal Vepuri,Nitesh Banta,Jeff Fluhr,Dave Eisenberg,David Haber,Kirsten Green,Shervin Pishevar,Jordan Cooper,Mo Koyfman,Elyse Colen,Andrew Hunt,Josh Spear,Summit Series,Mark Peter Davis,Michael Duda,Kimball Thomas,Marshall Yang,Chris Paik,David Bell,Davis Smith,Lee Fixel,Dave Lerner,Brett Topche,Michael B.

"StyleSaint","We believe that by taking a “creator-to-closet” approach to fashion that prioritizes quality, sustainability, and the humanity behind clothing, we can change the world for the better. If we can do this while eliminating bloated retail costs for customers, then we can create a win/win opportunity that will forever revolutionize the fashion industry.

By designing non-disposable, core-of-your closet silk and lace essentials, we are returning to the industry’s roots of making things that matter, and things that last.

By selling these collections directly to customers online, we’ve escaped a model that requires excessive markups to offer revolutionary, affordable pricing year-round – because you shouldn’t have to wait for the things you covet to go on sale, and you shouldn’t have to choose between quality and price.","Brian Garrett,Allison Beal","Chris Farmer,Brian Lee,Erik Rannala,Michael Liou,Dennis Phelps,Dave Lerner,Daniel Broukhim,Sam Teller,Michael Broukhim,David Carter,Jonathan Becker","","Brian Lee,David Carter,Irene Au,James Yaffe","","Yes","https://angel.co/briangarrett,https://angel.co/allisonleebeal","https://angel.co/chriswfarmer,https://angel.co/brian-lee-2,https://angel.co/erik-rannala,https://angel.co/michael-liou,https://angel.co/dbrianphelps,https://angel.co/dave-lerner,https://angel.co/daniel-broukhim,https://angel.co/steller,https://angel.co/broukhim,https://angel.co/davidlcarter,https://angel.co/jonathan-becker","","https://angel.co/brian-lee-2,https://angel.co/davidlcarter,https://angel.co/ireneau,https://angel.co/james-yaffe","","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

"Precog","Precog is next-generation of analytics infrastructure, designed to enable companies to perform arbitrarily complex analytics on modern data types.

Modern data is messy, complex, and doesn&#x27;t fit into tables. It includes JSON values, documents, log files, and social media data.

If you just want to store modern data, you have lots of choices. You can store it in Hadoop, MongoDB, Cassandra, and lots of other places. But if you want to perform analytics on modern data, then you are forced to homogenize it, dumb it down, and make it fit into tables, where you must use SQL or SQL variants like Hive to perform analytics on it.

This process is extremely time-consuming, expensive, and brittle.

Precog rejects the notion that you have to adapt your data to your 30 year old analytics technology.

A friendly MakeSpace team member delivers high quality, durable, reusable plastic bins to a customer&#x27;s home which they then fill with whatever they want to store. We aren&#x27;t limited to the bins though-- we are happy to store other items including bicycles or oversized items that fit into one of our oversized cardboard boxes (as long as one person can carry it)

Our team returns and transports the customer&#x27;s bins to our secure storage facility until they decide they want them back. Customers can see what they have in storage on our website or mobile app and include pictures of what&#x27;s inside the bin for easy retrieval. Customer&#x27;s belongings can be returned to them in as little as 24 hours for a small fee.","Rahul Gandhi,Sam Rosen,Adam LeVasseur","Dave Morin,Scott Belsky,Chris Sacca,Naval Ravikant,Gary Vaynerchuk,Lee Linden,Mark Suster,Dharmesh Shah,Craig Shapiro,Kevin Colleran,Jared Kopf,Sam Lessin,Eric Kwan,Josh Spear,Mike Walsh,Talmadge O&#x27;Neill,Matt Mazzeo,Brad Svrluga,Mark Peter Davis,Tom Fallows,Jason Spinell,Matt Monahan,Jonah Goodhart,Michael McCartney,James Chi,Wouter Kneepkens,Aniq Rahman,James Lin,John Vanhara,Jason Lee,Brew Johnson,Jerome Poichet,Alberto Escarlate,Ricardo Poupada,Marcela Miyazawa,Jonathan Prober,Jeff Prober","Rion Harmon","Elliot Tomaeno,Michael Moss,Brandon Arbiter,Daniel Hughes","Sam Rosen","Yes","https://angel.co/rahul-gandhi,https://angel.co/samirosen,https://angel.co/adamjlev","https://angel.co/davemorin,https://angel.co/scottbelsky,https://angel.co/sacca,https://angel.co/naval,https://angel.co/gary,https://angel.co/lclinden,https://angel.co/msuster,https://angel.co/dharmesh,https://angel.co/cshapiro,https://angel.co/kevincolleran,https://angel.co/jhk,https://angel.co/lessin,https://angel.co/eric-kwan,https://angel.co/joshspear,https://angel.co/mwalsh,https://angel.co/talmadge,https://angel.co/mazzeo,https://angel.co/brad-svrluga,https://angel.co/mpd,https://angel.co/tom-fallows-963,https://angel.co/jason-spinell-1,https://angel.co/gomattymo,https://angel.co/jonah-goodhart,https://angel.co/michael-mccartney,https://angel.co/james-chi,https://angel.co/wouterkneepkens,https://angel.co/aniq-rahman,https://angel.co/jameslin,https://angel.co/eastbiz,https://angel.co/jasonlee,https://angel.co/butter310,https://angel.co/jerome-poichet,https://angel.co/alberto-escarlate,https://angel.co/ricardo-poupada,https://angel.co/marcelam,https://angel.co/jonathanprober,https://angel.co/jeff-prober","https://angel.co/rion-harmon","https://angel.co/tomaeno,https://angel.co/michael-moss,https://angel.co/brandon-arbiter-1,https://angel.co/hughesdan","https://angel.co/samirosen","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

Anyone can sell(monetize) his/her freetime by offering activities &amp; experiences to residents and travelers at tushky&#x27;s online marketplace.

It&#x27;s super easy to list an experience and start selling the extra 2 hours you have on Sunday, for example.

"Keen IO","Keen IO is a fully managed cloud API that lets developers build complex, hyper-custom, large-scale analytics and data science features directly into their web, mobile, or Internet of Things applications.

Our currency is event data, and events are a pretty broad abstraction.  Every time someone draws a breath, clicks a link, loads a website, pauses a song, or starts a car, there&#x27;s an event.  Events like these, in large aggregate, are extremely useful -- and therefore valuable :)

It&#x27;s probably worth mentioning that we&#x27;re a platform company, not a product company.  This means our customers are using the platform to build for an emergent and rapidly growing set of use cases.  The same flexibility that makes us future-proof for a given customer also makes us future-proof from a market perspective.  So while a product company seeks a certain kind of product-market fit, we allow product-market fit to come to us:  our customers build it for themselves.","Kyle Wild,Dan Kador,Ryan Spraetz","Othman Laraki,Zachary Bogue,Matt Ocko,Jared Kopf,David Cohen,Ullas Naik,Pietro Dova,Pejman Nozad,Dave McClure,Jason Seats,Zachary Aarons,Nicole Glaros,Paul Singh,Paul Kedrosky,Pat Matthews,Matt Humphrey,Kevin Dick,Eric Norlin,Cloud Power Capital,Sunil Dhaliwal,David Lambert,Sam Choi,Jeff Pomeranz,Morris Wheeler,Dirk Elmendorf,Issac Roth,Jim Deters,Loren Siebert,Right Side Capital Management,George Karidis,Anne Johnson","Josh Dzielak,Cory Watson,Dustin Larimer,Justin Johnson,Michelle Wetzler,Nick Lashinsky,Sam Gammon,Caroline Fernandes,Rebecca Standig,Micah Wolfe,Alan Shreve,Peter Nachbaur","Brad Feld,Jud Valeski,Peter Werner,Dean McCall,Jason Rockwood,Mike Troy","Jim Andelman,Sunil Dhaliwal,Kyle Wild,Dan Kador,Ryan Spraetz","Yes","https://angel.co/dorkitude,https://angel.co/dkador,https://angel.co/ryan-spraetz","https://angel.co/othman,https://angel.co/zackbogue,https://angel.co/mattocko,https://angel.co/jhk,https://angel.co/davidcohen,https://angel.co/ullas-naik,https://angel.co/pdova,https://angel.co/pejmannozad,https://angel.co/davemcclure,https://angel.co/jason-seats,https://angel.co/zachaarons,https://angel.co/nicole-glaros,https://angel.co/paulsingh,https://angel.co/pkedrosky,https://angel.co/patmatthews,https://angel.co/zellunit,https://angel.co/kevin-dick,https://angel.co/eric-norlin,https://angel.co/cloud-power-capital,https://angel.co/dhaliwas,https://angel.co/dave-lambert,https://angel.co/sam-choi,https://angel.co/jeff-pomeranz,https://angel.co/mowheeler,https://angel.co/dirk-elmendorf,https://angel.co/issac-roth,https://angel.co/yodeets,https://angel.co/loren-siebert,https://angel.co/right-side-capital-management-1,https://angel.co/george-karidis,https://angel.co/annejohn","https://angel.co/dzello,https://angel.co/cory-watson,https://angel.co/larimer,https://angel.co/elof,https://angel.co/wetzler,https://angel.co/nick-lashinsky,https://angel.co/samgammon,https://angel.co/caroline-fernandes,https://angel.co/rebeccastandig,https://angel.co/wolfe,https://angel.co/alan-shreve,https://angel.co/peter-nachbaur","https://angel.co/bfeld,https://angel.co/jvaleski,https://angel.co/peter-werner,https://angel.co/therealdeanmccall,https://angel.co/jasonrockwood,https://angel.co/mike-troy","https://angel.co/jimandelman,https://angel.co/dhaliwas,https://angel.co/dorkitude,https://angel.co/dkador,https://angel.co/ryan-spraetz","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

Our technology replaces any or all of the siloed data protection and availability storage applications you might be using today – backup, snapshot, business continuity, disaster recovery, test &amp; dev, analytics, and anything else that creates copies of your production data – with a single, complete storage system, purpose-built to manage copy data. Doing so delivers recovery times in minutes instead of hours, even for large scale application data sets, while slashing total cost of ownership by as much as 90% versus the traditional model.

Actifio pioneered the industry’s first storage system optimized for managing copies of production data, eliminating redundant silos of IT infrastructure and data management applications.","","Michael Skok,Bob Hower,Jit Saxena,Jamie Goldstein,Technology Crossover Ventures,Peter Levine","Michael Troiano,Mike Falb","","Bob Hower,Jit Saxena,Peter Levine","No","","https://angel.co/michael-skok,https://angel.co/bob-hower,https://angel.co/jit-saxena,https://angel.co/jamie-goldstein,https://angel.co/technology-crossover-ventures,https://angel.co/peter-levine","https://angel.co/michael-troiano,https://angel.co/mikefalb","","https://angel.co/bob-hower,https://angel.co/jit-saxena,https://angel.co/peter-levine","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

Technical Machine&#x27;s flagship product is Tessel - the world&#x27;s first hardware prototyping platform that is programmable entirely in JavaScript with built-in WiFi. Tessel makes it easy for web and mobile developers to take a hardware idea from plan to prototype to product because it uses software paradigms and tool developers already use: Node.JS compatibility, remote deployment, JavaScript programming and more. 

Tessel&#x27;s software can grow with developers. Not only will the JavaScript runtime be fully open-source and portable to all ARM Cortex-M chips but Tessel will also offer a cloud-software service suite that will make product development easier including aggregate usage data, remote firmware updates, and crash reports.

"Human Diagnosis Project","Our mission: one open system, created by the global medical community, that comprehensively maps any human health problem to its possible diagnoses. Over time, such a system could dramatically alter the cost of, access to, and efficacy of health care globally.

The Human Diagnosis Project will allow stakeholders across health care (patients, doctors, insurers, pharma companies, med schools, foundations, governments, etc.) to make both better health outcomes and resource allocation decisions.

The Project will initially be seeded via contributions from medical students, residents and physicians through a learning/licensing/practice tool. As the tool is used, Human Dx encodes structured data regarding how doctors think and uses machine learning, data mining, and other approaches to process and interpret this data.","Human Dx","","","Naval Ravikant,Mitch Kapor","Albert Wenger","Yes","https://angel.co/human-dx","","","https://angel.co/naval,https://angel.co/mkapor","https://angel.co/albertwenger",""

"Knotch","Knotch is a network that allows people to connect based on shared interests. To brands, artists, politicians, etc, Knotch is a source of accurate &amp; structured sentiment data on topics relevant to them. 

From a consumer standpoint, Knotch is the Twitter for the 99%: it gives everyone a stage to express their opinions/thoughts in front of all those who care about the topic in discussion. Moreover, it&#x27;s the first network that allows users to create an identity based on their interests &amp; opinions (aka knotches) and to connect with like-minded people from outside of their social graph.

In the words of our users:

Ben, Illinois: &quot;This is an app to connect with people from around the world with the same interests and become friends.&quot;

Danyi, North Carolina: &quot;It&#x27;s a place where I meet people who care about what I have to say. I love Knotch.&quot;

"Joule","Joule is developing a revolutionary platform for renewable fuel and chemical production that is expected to eclipse the scalability, productivities and cost efficiency of any known alternative to fossil fuel today.

Unlike fuels produced from agricultural or algal biomass, Joule produces fuels directly and continuously from sunlight and waste CO2 in a novel, Gas-to-Liquid conversion process. The company&#x27;s engineered biocatalysts directly produce and secrete targeted fuels and chemicals, avoiding the need for biomass feedstocks and complex downstream processing.

The entire process takes place in a novel SolarConverter® system, from photon capture to product creation and initial separation, with no requirement for arable land, fresh water or crops. Furthermore, this uniquely modular system can achieve replicable productivity whether installed across 250 or 25,000 acres - demonstrating Joule&#x27;s capability without the scale-up costs and risks that have hindered biofuels for years.","","Flagship Ventures,Ish Dugal","Micah Merrick","","","No","","https://angel.co/flagship-ventures,https://angel.co/ish-dugal","https://angel.co/micah-merrick","","","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

"Good.Co","Good.Co is fixing hiring with user-driven analytics that measure culture-fit. 

The time and cost to hire today is the highest it’s ever been. 50% of new hires don&#x27;t last more than 18 months due to culture misfit.  While the Internet has solved sourcing problems, it has paralyzed hiring. 

Good.Co is taking a provocative, consumer-first approach to fixing hiring and retention from the bottom-up. Good.Co&#x27;s purposely playful experience is powered by a scientifically-valid and self-learning algorithm that takes 90% less time compared to traditional assessments.    

Social features fuel rapid collection of data-assets on users’ personalities, peers, teams, and workplaces - allowing Good.Co to create a more efficient co-selection process. The data is immensely impactful for employer branding, team performance and recruiting. 

Good.Co&#x27;s user base is growing at ~80% per month. Premium analytics to be released in Jan 2014 to 15 companies.

The reasons behind this spend are 1) that tax preparation is time consuming, 2) paying less tax requires intimate knowledge of tax laws and 3) these are complex and keep changing every year. Half of this spend alone comes from self-employed.

SimpleTax helps freelancers by connecting to online services where financial information for the tax return can be found, ensuring all amounts go into the right boxes, filing directly with HMRC and telling them what they should do to pay less tax.

"Yhat","Yhat provides a seamless way to run predictive models in production systems. The platform includes everything needed to deploy, test, and manage an industrial-grade analytics stack with zero overhead. It can be deployed in the cloud or on-prem.

YH allows the 99% of companies whose core business isn&#x27;t data but for which data is a high-value tool given the right know-how to unlock analysts&#x27; insights in a way previously available only to companies like comScore or Google. Data scientists get packages for deploying predictive APIs with tools they know (R, Python), integrated tools to horse-race candidate models, and a web-based GUI for configuration and measuring the efficacy of their models.

By enabling complex analytical models to be developed, deployed and integrated quickly, YH lets teams avoid long and costly throw-it-over-the-wall processes that make hand-off from data scientist to engineer painful.

The team recently worked at On Deck Capital and before that EverFi and comScore.","Greg Lamp,Austin Ogilvie","Eliot Durbin,Brian Laung Aoaeh,Thomas Loverro,Jeff Parkinson,Alexander Saint-Amand,David Moon,KEC Holdings,Drew Conway,Tim Ogilvie,boldstart ventures,Prabhdeep Singh,Contour Ventures,Will Ballard,Matthew Russell,Peter Ogilvie,Ian Dominguez,Mark Lamp","Jessie Frazelle","Alexander Saint-Amand,Drew Conway,Tim Ogilvie,Prabhdeep Singh,Will Ballard,Tom Davidson","Greg Lamp,Austin Ogilvie","Yes","https://angel.co/glamp,https://angel.co/austinogilvie","https://angel.co/etdurbin,https://angel.co/brian-laung-aoaeh,https://angel.co/thomas-loverro,https://angel.co/jeff-parkinson,https://angel.co/alexander-saint-amand,https://angel.co/david-moon,https://angel.co/kec-holdings,https://angel.co/drew-conway,https://angel.co/tim-ogilvie,https://angel.co/boldstart-ventures,https://angel.co/singhpa,https://angel.co/contour-ventures,https://angel.co/will-ballard,https://angel.co/matthew-russell,https://angel.co/peter-46,https://angel.co/ian-dominguez,https://angel.co/mark-lamp","https://angel.co/frazelledazzell","https://angel.co/alexander-saint-amand,https://angel.co/drew-conway,https://angel.co/tim-ogilvie,https://angel.co/singhpa,https://angel.co/will-ballard,https://angel.co/tommydavidson","https://angel.co/glamp,https://angel.co/austinogilvie","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

"Sensentia","Sensentia automates complex healthcare administration/operation tasks that until now required human intervention, driving higher efficiency and better quality of service at lower costs:

- Benefit eligibility inquiries to payers.
- Claim processing and validation.
- Claim adjudication.

Sensentia&#x27;s platform is capable of handling such tasks automatically at a high reliability (&gt;95%).

Our first product helps health insurers handle the billions of complex real-time benefit eligibility inquiries from care-providers and members. 

Currently handled by call-center agents, answering is slow, expensive, and suffers from high error rates. 

Sensentia offers, for the first time, a fully automated, highly reliable, web/mobile-based alternative.

In a recent proof-of-concept pilot with a top 5 insurer, Sensentia&#x27;s system demonstrated 97% accuracy answering real provider inquiries based on representative original policies.

The system is as intuitive as asking another human a question.","Jan Jungclaus,Ronen Amit","David Davidovic,Todd N Mekjian","Alon Moshe,Peter Stephenson","Nova Spivack,Dan Barry","","Yes","https://angel.co/jan-jungclaus-1,https://angel.co/ronen-amit","https://angel.co/ddavidovic,https://angel.co/toddmekjian","https://angel.co/alon-moshe,https://angel.co/peter-stephenson","https://angel.co/novaspivack,https://angel.co/dan-barry-2","",""
"Seene","We have launched Seene, an app that lets iPhone users take lifelike 3D photos that can be shared within the app and on the web and social networks. We were recently named as one of the best apps of 2013 by Techcrunch.

Seene creates a new kind of photo which brings together image, depth and movement in a way that is at once both familiar and new – a richer, more interactive evolution of what a photo can be that responds to viewer interaction. This represents a step change in sharable visual content because the world isn&#x27;t flat, and with Seene neither is the way that you share it. 

We launched on October 14th 2013 and have had strong user traction from day one.

Thanx is a revolutionary approach to the traditional customer loyalty program. Our mobile-focused consumer experience eliminates painful printouts, loyalty cards, and check-ins for consumers — instead the entire program is linked to any credit or debit card. Rewards accrue automatically and instantly without any additional steps at checkout. Thanx is free for consumers but our real business is actually in helping merchants develop closer relationships with their best customers through data-driven marketing. As a Software-as-a-Service offering, we require no point-of-sale integration making it a truly frictionless experience. Merchants launch customized retention marketing programs in minutes instead of months and at a fraction of the cost of existing solutions.","Zachary Goldstein","Dave Eisenberg,Stephanie Palmeri,Jeff Clavier,Ann Miura Ko,Charles Hudson,David Tisch,Andy Dunn,Pietro Dova,Andrea Zurek,Andy Rachleff,Menlo Ventures,Jon Venverloh","Aaron Newton,Mark Bult,Marc Fernandez,Caroline Jaquiss","David Silverglide","","Yes","https://angel.co/zachgoldstein","https://angel.co/dave-eisenberg,https://angel.co/stephanie-palmeri,https://angel.co/jeff,https://angel.co/annimaniac,https://angel.co/chudson,https://angel.co/davidtisch,https://angel.co/andydunn,https://angel.co/pdova,https://angel.co/andreazurek,https://angel.co/andy-rachleff,https://angel.co/menlo-ventures,https://angel.co/jon-venverloh","https://angel.co/aaron-newton,https://angel.co/mark-bult,https://angel.co/marcferna,https://angel.co/caroline-jaquiss","https://angel.co/dsilverglide","",""

We&#x27;re building new infrastructures to drive the cost of payment processing down… eventually to zero, so businesses don&#x27;t have to pay $50BN in card fees each year. We&#x27;re opening up APIs and SDKs to enable merchants, developers and anybody else to build incredible apps that leverage the information in each transaction.

Our vision is big, exciting, challenging and quite possibly impossible. But we&#x27;re a company filled with smart people (70+ and counting), backed by $50MM from other smart people (Google Ventures, Deutsche-Telekom, founders of Discover Card) and we&#x27;re on the road to making our vision a reality.

LevelUp has built one great application, a utility app that lets you pay with your phone and save at 5000+ merchants. But, there&#x27;s a lot more that LevelUp can do.

Consumers want someone to cut through the clutter and surface up the best products in this growing and popular vertical. And the market&#x27;s big... the handmade market is $30B, gifts and home decor are $65B and jewelry is $63B.  

We launched the Shoppe product line 16 months ago with a significant head start of 2 million organic email sign-ups from our legacy local mobile business. This is a big advantage as there isn&#x27;t a current leader at curating and creating demand in the independent and authentic goods market and user acquisition is the lifeblood of early ecommerce companies.","David Payne,Michael Tavani","Mike Brown Jr,John Backus,Tim Rowe,Thanasis Delistathis,Ben Lerer,New Atlantic Ventures,Stephen Stark","Sabir Muhammad,Calvin Yu,Paul Heerin,Brian Cox,Jarod Jones,Andy Pittman","Tom Bates","Thanasis Delistathis","Yes","https://angel.co/david-payne-2,https://angel.co/tavani","https://angel.co/mikebrownjr,https://angel.co/jcbackus,https://angel.co/tim-rowe,https://angel.co/thanasis-delistathis,https://angel.co/benjlerer,https://angel.co/new-atlantic-ventures,https://angel.co/stephen-stark","https://angel.co/sabir-muhammad,https://angel.co/cyu,https://angel.co/paul-heerin,https://angel.co/brian-cox-1,https://angel.co/jarod-jones,https://angel.co/andy-pittman","https://angel.co/tom-bates","https://angel.co/thanasis-delistathis","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

"OpenIncubate","OpenIncubate is a new accelerator program formed to fund teams using open source IP to transform the IT infrastructure layer, backed by Austin Ventures, Battery Ventures, and The Valley Fund and hosted at Capital Factory.

The three venture firms have joined forces to create OpenIncubate in response to two key technology shifts they believe will define the next decade of computing:  
1) The emergence of open networking and the software-defined data center, and 
2) The growing prominence of open source initiatives such as Open Compute.

The OpenIncubate program offers seed funding, work space, and mentorship to admitted teams, with no pre-defined limit on the number of teams or dollars invested.  
Qualifying companies or teams of entrepreneurs must be product-oriented (versus services), and must utilize open source frameworks aimed at building on and refining the concept of the software-defined data centers in areas of innovation including hardware, software, and networking.","","","Joshua Baer,Dai Truong,John Komkov,Cole Crawford","","","Yes","","","https://angel.co/joshuabaer,https://angel.co/dai,https://angel.co/john-komkov,https://angel.co/cole-crawford","","",""

"CheckiO","CheckiO is an online game where coders compete and collaborate.

For experienced developers CheckiO is a fun competition and a way to share their knowledge.

For novice coders it is a self tutoring community where code review and feedback are game elements.

For companies it’s a tool to find and prescreen coders or crowd source software on a challenge basis. 

Developers around the world solve coding puzzles, compete and cooperate with one another while traveling in an adventurous world of CheckiO. We are growing very rapidly with Python community. Guido van Rossum, the author of Python, volunteers to publish his code reviews and inspire our users. After Python we are going to launch JavaScript with more languages to come. 

Coders learn from one another&#x27;s experience by reviewing and ranking the most elegant and creative solutions. For businesses we help share their engineering culture through their unique challenges and in such a way attract the best talent.","Liza Avramenko,Alexander Lyabah,Oleg Klevtsov","Bob Mason,Jay Batson,Walter A.

On one hand, growing companies who want to focus on doing what they love are plagued by user-unfriendly and time-consuming solutions for essential tasks like invoicing and payments. On the other, enterprises striving for an efficient digital future find themselves compromising when partners aren’t ready, willing or able to join such a reality.

Tradeshift rethinks all of this. In establishing a platform for all your business interactions, it helps smaller companies run more efficiently, harnessing the power of their network to create new value from old processes. Apps like e-invoicing become a route to getting paid faster and open doors like dynamic discounting to the entire long tail of the supply chain.

"Amplitude","Amplitude does mobile analytics to help app developers optimize their in-app purchasing, engagement, and retention. Mobile app usage is growing at a rapid pace but the options for analytics aren’t adequate to meet mobile developer needs.

With Amplitude, developers can look at their funnels, retention, and revenues, as well as powerfully segment everything. All data is updated in real-time the second it comes in.

Amplitude scales up to hundreds of millions of events while also allowing you to drill down to the level of the individual user. Amplitude supports integration at any level, including access to the raw data for custom querying written in SQL.

"Bluetrain Mobile","The future of consumer marketing is mobile and multi-screen. In order to compete, marketers need a new generation of websites that adapt to the unique behaviors and capabilities of each screen including smartphones, tablets and desktops.

Responsive design enables marketers to publish content on any screen, but for data-driven consumer marketers who care deeply about optimizing lead generation and revenue on each screen, current approaches to responsive design fall short because they give marketers little or no control of the user experience of each device once the site is live. 

Our vision is to build a responsive server side (RESS) platform that puts the intelligence of responsive design in the hands of marketers themselves. Bluetrain will make it easier for marketers and their agencies to build and optimize a new generation of websites that provide far greater freedom and control of the user experience on every device.","Steffan Berelowitz","Ryan Moore,Joe Caruso,Gene Zimon","Mike Mai","Art Papas","","Yes","https://angel.co/steffan-berelowitz","https://angel.co/rrmoore73,https://angel.co/joecaruso2020,https://angel.co/gene-zimon","https://angel.co/mikemai2awesome","https://angel.co/art-papas","","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

"Bondsy","WHAT IS BONDSY?
Bondsy is a new way for friends to trade things you can’t put a price on. When you&#x27;re not restricted to paying strictly with money, things get a lot more interesting. =D

WHAT CAN YOU OFFER TO YOUR FRIENDS?
Products (gadgets, books, games...)
Perishable items (concert tickets, leftovers, gift cards...)
Opportunities (job, roommate, carpool...)
Handmade goods (jewelry, art, hats...)
Skills (dancing, guitar lessons...)
Experiences (playdates, classes...)
Favors (moving help, babysitting, dogsitting...)

FRIENDS ONLY
You are more comfortable transacting with friends. And, you’re more likely to trust their friends than strangers. It’s important to highlight: everything is private on Bondsy.

SNAP A PHOTO, WRITE A STORY, ADD PRICETAGS
Pricetags are freeform, so you can ask for anything in return. When you want something, tap ‘Grab’ and make an offer.","Diego Zambrano","Josh Stylman,Peter Hershberg,Adam Rothenberg,David Tisch,Steve Martocci,Patrick Keane,David Cohen,Joshua Kushner","Diego Zambrano,Josh Goldstein","Peter Hershberg,Gavin Becker,Felipe Memoria","Joshua Kushner,Diego Zambrano","Yes","https://angel.co/zambrano","https://angel.co/jstylman,https://angel.co/hershberg,https://angel.co/adam-rothenberg,https://angel.co/davidtisch,https://angel.co/steve-martocci,https://angel.co/phkeane,https://angel.co/davidcohen,https://angel.co/joshuakushner","https://angel.co/zambrano,https://angel.co/joshuargoldstein","https://angel.co/hershberg,https://angel.co/grokstar,https://angel.co/fmemoria","https://angel.co/joshuakushner,https://angel.co/zambrano",""

"Hangtime","Hangtime is the only app that shows you where your friends will be in the future so you don&#x27;t miss out on a chance to hang out with them.

There are apps that tell you where your friends are now, Highlight, FourSquare…
BUT
Where your friends are now isn’t useful  You likely have plans or you are notified too late to change plans
SO 
Consumers need an app that tells them where their friends will be in the future and we built it for them.
Many have tried to solve this problem but never with our approach, crowd source data (10 million events and counting), unique flow interface and big data pipeline that delivers this experience in seconds others take hours.  
People who join share their events with their friends and (if public) other Hangtime users.  This is quite similar to the map and route data each Waze user brings to their community.  Users curate events by clicking Interested like Waze users identify better routes thru traffic.  Because of this we are often called Waze for events.","Karl Jacob,Mark Halstead,Allan Carroll","Josh Elman,Dave Morin,Karl Jacob,David Lee,Webb Investment Network,Josh Felser,Saar Gur,Maynard Webb,Mark H Goldstein,Kevin Colleran,Chris Howard,Matt Ocko,Kristen Koh Goldstein,Michael Tanne,Tom Dare,Alexander Lloyd,Mark Pincus,Eric Chin,Tim Kendall,Steven Lurie,Dave McClure,Dennis Phelps,Christine Herron,Chris Hobbs,Ben Smith,Dave Whorton,Peter Hsing,Merlin Kauffman","Karl Jacob,Mark Halstead,Allan Carroll","","","Yes","https://angel.co/karl,https://angel.co/mark-halstead-73,https://angel.co/allancarroll","https://angel.co/josh-elman,https://angel.co/davemorin,https://angel.co/karl,https://angel.co/daslee,https://angel.co/webb-investment-network-1,https://angel.co/joshmedia,https://angel.co/saarsaar,https://angel.co/maynard-webb,https://angel.co/markgee,https://angel.co/kevincolleran,https://angel.co/chrishoward,https://angel.co/mattocko,https://angel.co/kristenkoh,https://angel.co/mtanne,https://angel.co/tom-dare,https://angel.co/alex01,https://angel.co/mark-pincus,https://angel.co/chindogger,https://angel.co/tim-kendall,https://angel.co/steven-lurie,https://angel.co/davemcclure,https://angel.co/dbrianphelps,https://angel.co/christine,https://angel.co/christianhobbs,https://angel.co/bentsmithfour,https://angel.co/dwhorton,https://angel.co/superuser,https://angel.co/merlin","https://angel.co/karl,https://angel.co/mark-halstead-73,https://angel.co/allancarroll","","","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

"Sprig","Sprig provides healthy food on-demand. Anytime you are hungry, you can order a locally-sourced, healthy dinner option directly from your smartphone. It is as easy as calling an Uber, and meals are $10. Once you order, it takes 20 minutes to get to your door. All meals are cooked by Executive Chef Nate Keller, who was an executive chef at Google, where he grew the culinary program from 400 to 40,000 employees.

The average customer ordered 2.8 times in their first 4 weeks. It is in the App Store as &quot;Sprig: Dinner on Demand&quot;.

This is what makes Sprig unique:
1) Real-time. Customers order and get their food within 20 minutes on average.
2) Hot without degrading quality. We spent 6 months on operations and culinary research to figure out how to keep the food quality high even through the delivery process.
3) The food. Restaurant food is unhealthy, especially delivery. It&#x27;s full of salt, butter and oil. Our food is seasonal, local and good for you.","Gagan Biyani,Neeraj Berry,Matt Kent,Morgan Springer","Rick Marini,Darian Shirazi,Andrew McCollum,Simon Rothman,Haroon Mokhtarzada,Dan Martell,Sean Aggarwal,Jonathon Triest,Lawrence Braitman,Brian OMalley,Russell Fradin,Pascal Levy-Garboua,Mark Sugarman,Aaron Vinson,Brett Jackson,Christopher Chan,Jim Payne,Brett deMarrais,Jeff Lu,Vijay Nagappan,Songhua Hu,Somik Behera,Rajmohan Rajagopalan,500 Startups,Andrew Garvin","Nate Keller","Logan Green","","Yes","https://angel.co/gaganbiyani,https://angel.co/neeraj-berry,https://angel.co/matt-kent,https://angel.co/morgan-springer","https://angel.co/rmarini,https://angel.co/darian314,https://angel.co/amccollum,https://angel.co/simonrothman,https://angel.co/haroon,https://angel.co/danmartell,https://angel.co/sean-aggarwal,https://angel.co/jtriest,https://angel.co/lbraitman,https://angel.co/brian-omalley,https://angel.co/rfradin,https://angel.co/pascal-levy-garboua,https://angel.co/mark-sugarman,https://angel.co/avinson,https://angel.co/brett-jackson,https://angel.co/christopher-chan-1,https://angel.co/jimpayne,https://angel.co/brettdemarrais,https://angel.co/jiffylu,https://angel.co/vijay-nagappan,https://angel.co/songhua-hu,https://angel.co/somikbehera,https://angel.co/rajraj,https://angel.co/500startups,https://angel.co/garvin-andrew","https://angel.co/n8","https://angel.co/logangreen","","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links

"KeepSafe","KeepSafe gives you control over who sees what. 
We live in a digital world that wants us to share everything, but we all have boundaries.

Think of that moment when you show photos at Thanksgiving ... 
   and your aunt swipes far enough to see pictures of your last party mayhem.

KeepSafe gives you control over who sees what. 

Founded in 2012, we have 15 million customers who trust our products. We’re a three-person team, backed by great investors and we’re only getting started.

Our traction points to a real nerve we’re touching. We address the fundamental human need for controlling your personal space. 

But what does personal privacy mean in the digital age? How will people control this in an easy, intuitive way? How can we let individuals share documents, photos, messages, without sacrificing privacy, control or security?

We address these challenges as we build out the solution for the future of privacy.","Philipp Berner,Zouhair Belkoura","David Rusenko,Paul Veradittakit,Christof Wittig,Nuno Goncalves Pedro","Aline Lerner,Sadaf Ayub","David Rusenko,Andy Johns,Arthur van Hoff","","Yes","https://angel.co/philipp-berner,https://angel.co/zouhair-belkoura","https://angel.co/drusenko,https://angel.co/veradittakit,https://angel.co/christof-wittig,https://angel.co/nuno-goncalves-pedro","https://angel.co/aline-lerner,https://angel.co/sadaf-ayub","https://angel.co/drusenko,https://angel.co/andyjohns,https://angel.co/avh","","Stage,Date,Amount,Press,Investors,Investor Links
