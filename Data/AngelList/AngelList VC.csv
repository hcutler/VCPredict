"Balderton Capital","What Makes Us Different

We are one of the largest venture capital funds in Europe, and that means we are better positioned to support our companies for longer, with stronger resources.

Operational experience

We have founded companies, grown companies from one to thousands of employees, taken companies public in the US and in Europe bought, sold and merged companies. 

International scope

Our six investment partners come from five different countries. We all have worked in several regions of the world from Paris and London to Silicon Valley and Asia. 

Equal partnership

We function as equal partners. This means that the success of the companies we invest in provide equal benefit to all the partners, regardless of who was the direct representative of our firm on the board.

Long-term focus

Balderton’s aim is to help build long-lasting great companies. We look for the longer-term gains, and the companies with the biggest potential for sustained growth.","Friend.ly,Memrise,Recorded Future,MedicAnimal,GoCardless,Top10.com,Psykosoft,SCVNGR,Betfair,LevelUp,Daylife,Tabula,Wonga,Gemvara,MySQL,Tictail,Kupivip,Bebo,LoveFilm,carwow,Bling Nation,Icera,DisplayLink,Kalido,Wooga,","","","Roberto Bonanzinga,Harry Briggs,Rob Moffat,James Wise,Bernard Liautaud,Daniel Waterhouse,Mark Evans","",Yes,"https://angel.co/friend-ly,https://angel.co/memrise,https://angel.co/recorded-future,https://angel.co/medicanimal,https://angel.co/gocardless,https://angel.co/top10-com,https://angel.co/psykosoft,https://angel.co/scvngr,https://angel.co/betfair,https://angel.co/levelup,https://angel.co/daylife,https://angel.co/tabula,https://angel.co/wonga,https://angel.co/gemvara,https://angel.co/mysql,https://angel.co/tictail,https://angel.co/kupivip,https://angel.co/bebo,https://angel.co/lovefilm,https://angel.co/carwow,https://angel.co/bling-nation,https://angel.co/icera,https://angel.co/displaylink,https://angel.co/kalido,https://angel.co/wooga,","","","https://angel.co/bonanzinga,https://angel.co/harrybriggs,https://angel.co/robmoff,https://angel.co/jpwise,https://angel.co/bliautaud,https://angel.co/daniel-waterhouse,https://angel.co/mark-evans-5",""

"Bullpen Capital","Bullpen Capital  is an early-stage venture fund being formed to make follow-on investments in Internet technology companies that have been initially funded by super-angel capital efficient funds.  Extending the capital efficient model beyond the seed stage keeps options open for the founders and investors. Working closely with the leading super-angel funds, we can act quicker than most other venture investors.

The rise of the super-angels is a capital market response to a new technology trend: the rise of the lean venture, typically an Internet service deploying fast-to-market technology which enables rapid market validation before large capital requirements. The super-angels are emerging as a natural response to a decades long over-sizing of venture firms, built more to fund the semiconductor factories of the past than Internet firms of today.

Bullpen works with its super-angel partners to:

•Extend a seed round to give a start-up more time to prove itself
•Fund a company requiring more early money than the usual seed deal
•Restart a company that is a “fallen angel” but still has great promise
•Fund a “rising star” needing a small B round it before it goes to VC auction
The lean model does not depend on the lightning strike of finding the rocket-ship that is immediately successful after its seed round.  Almost every rocket-ship has a rocky start, requiring post-seed nurturing before ascending.  This usually entails one or more “pivots”, in which a company’s basic direction must be changed to find its market.  These changes are wrenching, and require additional capital before proof points are met.  Bullpen’s major role is to lead post-seed stage rounds that support these pivots.

With Bullpen rolling up its sleeves and helping with the pivot round, traditional VC becomes more efficient by focusing on financing companies as they are handed off for scaling, requiring levels of investment consistent with traditional economics.This creates a win for the super angel, the founders, and the traditional VC, as Bullpen helps makes the entire financing arc more efficient","Lifecrowd,Founders Den,Life360,Tello; creators of PassTools,Assistly,Perceptual Networks,Chartio,Proformative,SendHub,Appboy,Namely,Sightly,echoecho,Ness Computing,Grassroots Unwired","Paul Martino,Duncan Davidson","Matt Ocko,Tak Miyata,Ullas Naik,Tanveer Ali,Samir Kaji","James Conlon","Paul Martino,Duncan Davidson",Yes,"https://angel.co/lifecrowd,https://angel.co/foundersden,https://angel.co/life360,https://angel.co/tello-creators-of-passtools,https://angel.co/assistly,https://angel.co/perceptual-networks,https://angel.co/chartio,https://angel.co/proformative,https://angel.co/sendhub,https://angel.co/appboy,https://angel.co/namely,https://angel.co/sightly,https://angel.co/echoecho,https://angel.co/ness-computing,https://angel.co/grassroots-unwired","https://angel.co/ahpah,https://angel.co/duncandavi","https://angel.co/mattocko,https://angel.co/tak-miyata,https://angel.co/ullas-naik,https://angel.co/tanveer,https://angel.co/samir-kaji","https://angel.co/james-conlon","https://angel.co/ahpah,https://angel.co/duncandavi"

"Data Collective","Data Collective invests in entrepreneurs building Big Data companies.

Big Data companies capture, store, secure, transmit, transform, and analyze data for economic advantage, either with huge volumes (terabytes to exabytes), or at tremendous speed (microseconds to seconds), or both.

Big Data companies can come to market solving hard infrastructure problems, taking leadership in vertical B2B markets, or as truly data-driven consumer products. The common thread is that the founding team has the experience and discipline to solve data problems at novel scale, speed, or level of insight, and ideally all three.

Our strong network, operational experience and technical background delivers unique value to entrepreneurs. We still read code. We understand chip architecture and how to build racks. We&#x27;ve run Hadoop jobs ourselves and built VM farms. And we will be there at 3 am to cheer the new build or at 7 am to help land that new customer.","Freshplum,Kaggle,ZenPayroll,Swiftype,Space Monkey,Rescale,Priceonomics,LendUp,SlidePay,MemSQL,Parse,MixRank,Firebase,MongoHQ,Prism Skylabs,Weotta,Fliptop,Transcriptic,GetGoing,Apcera,Signifyd,Simpler,Keen IO,MindSumo,TempoDB,","Zachary Bogue,Matt Ocko","Jonathan Abrams,Adrian Aoun,David Popowitz,Pat Matthews,Florian Leibert,Alex Stamos,Peter Skomoroch","Alex Stamos","Zachary Bogue,Matt Ocko",Yes,"https://angel.co/freshplum,https://angel.co/kaggle,https://angel.co/zenpayroll,https://angel.co/swiftype,https://angel.co/space-monkey,https://angel.co/rescale,https://angel.co/priceonomics,https://angel.co/lendup,https://angel.co/slidepay,https://angel.co/memsql,https://angel.co/parse,https://angel.co/mixrank,https://angel.co/firebase,https://angel.co/mongohq,https://angel.co/prism-skylabs,https://angel.co/weotta,https://angel.co/fliptop,https://angel.co/transcriptic,https://angel.co/getgoing,https://angel.co/apcera,https://angel.co/signifyd,https://angel.co/simpler,https://angel.co/keen-io,https://angel.co/mindsumo,https://angel.co/tempodb,","https://angel.co/zackbogue,https://angel.co/mattocko","https://angel.co/abrams,https://angel.co/adrian-aoun,https://angel.co/popowitz,https://angel.co/patmatthews,https://angel.co/florian-leibert,https://angel.co/alexstamos,https://angel.co/peteskomoroch","https://angel.co/alexstamos","https://angel.co/zackbogue,https://angel.co/mattocko"

"Bullpen Capital","Bullpen Capital  is an early-stage venture fund being formed to make follow-on investments in Internet technology companies that have been initially funded by super-angel capital efficient funds.  Extending the capital efficient model beyond the seed stage keeps options open for the founders and investors. Working closely with the leading super-angel funds, we can act quicker than most other venture investors.

The rise of the super-angels is a capital market response to a new technology trend: the rise of the lean venture, typically an Internet service deploying fast-to-market technology which enables rapid market validation before large capital requirements. The super-angels are emerging as a natural response to a decades long over-sizing of venture firms, built more to fund the semiconductor factories of the past than Internet firms of today.

Bullpen works with its super-angel partners to:

•Extend a seed round to give a start-up more time to prove itself
•Fund a company requiring more early money than the usual seed deal
•Restart a company that is a “fallen angel” but still has great promise
•Fund a “rising star” needing a small B round it before it goes to VC auction
The lean model does not depend on the lightning strike of finding the rocket-ship that is immediately successful after its seed round.  Almost every rocket-ship has a rocky start, requiring post-seed nurturing before ascending.  This usually entails one or more “pivots”, in which a company’s basic direction must be changed to find its market.  These changes are wrenching, and require additional capital before proof points are met.  Bullpen’s major role is to lead post-seed stage rounds that support these pivots.

With Bullpen rolling up its sleeves and helping with the pivot round, traditional VC becomes more efficient by focusing on financing companies as they are handed off for scaling, requiring levels of investment consistent with traditional economics.This creates a win for the super angel, the founders, and the traditional VC, as Bullpen helps makes the entire financing arc more efficient","Lifecrowd,Founders Den,Life360,Tello; creators of PassTools,Assistly,Perceptual Networks,Chartio,Proformative,SendHub,Appboy,Namely,Sightly,echoecho,Ness Computing,Grassroots Unwired","Paul Martino,Duncan Davidson","Matt Ocko,Tak Miyata,Ullas Naik,Tanveer Ali,Samir Kaji","James Conlon","Paul Martino,Duncan Davidson",Yes,"https://angel.co/lifecrowd,https://angel.co/foundersden,https://angel.co/life360,https://angel.co/tello-creators-of-passtools,https://angel.co/assistly,https://angel.co/perceptual-networks,https://angel.co/chartio,https://angel.co/proformative,https://angel.co/sendhub,https://angel.co/appboy,https://angel.co/namely,https://angel.co/sightly,https://angel.co/echoecho,https://angel.co/ness-computing,https://angel.co/grassroots-unwired","https://angel.co/ahpah,https://angel.co/duncandavi","https://angel.co/mattocko,https://angel.co/tak-miyata,https://angel.co/ullas-naik,https://angel.co/tanveer,https://angel.co/samir-kaji","https://angel.co/james-conlon","https://angel.co/ahpah,https://angel.co/duncandavi"

"Social Starts","Social Starts in an angel investment fund for companies oriented toward building the “Social Construct” and the revolution this era is bringing. Businesses who recognize the Social Construct are building models that are beyond social media, social applications, social networking, or even a social platform. It’s the layering of a new methodology and perspective on the ways we communicate with each other in every part of life, both personally and in business. It changes the way we think of connections among people and how we get information, and it must be applied to all of our existing media, applications, networks, and other forms of human connection. The Social Construct will provide us with ways to solve problems that we couldn’t have imagined without such a framework, and every business must apply the Social Construct to the very fabric of how it runs its business. The new enterprises which provide these solutions are the ones in which Social Starts will invest and help catalyze.","MinoMonsters,SocialFlow,Chute,Adaptly,SocialWire,Bottlenose,Earbits (YC w11),DJZ,Nestio,Mass Relevance,TripleLift,The Tap Lab,Lua ,Tokyo Otaku Mode,FlyData,EveryMove,Granify,Kanvas,Ambassador ,Adelphic,Fitocracy,Battlefy,CrowdHall,FanFueled,Beyond Games,","William Lohse","","Nova Spivack,Brian Wang,Nick Bhardwaj,Mike Edelhart,Bob Wu","William Lohse",Yes,"https://angel.co/minomonsters,https://angel.co/socialflow,https://angel.co/chute,https://angel.co/adaptly,https://angel.co/socialwire,https://angel.co/bottlenose,https://angel.co/earbits-yc-w11,https://angel.co/djz,https://angel.co/nestio,https://angel.co/mass-relevance,https://angel.co/triplelift-1,https://angel.co/the-tap-lab,https://angel.co/lua-1,https://angel.co/tokyo-otaku-mode,https://angel.co/flydata,https://angel.co/everymove,https://angel.co/granify,https://angel.co/kanvas,https://angel.co/ambassador,https://angel.co/adelphic,https://angel.co/fitocracy,https://angel.co/battlefy,https://angel.co/crowdhall,https://angel.co/fanfueled,https://angel.co/beyond-games,","https://angel.co/william-lohse","","https://angel.co/novaspivack,https://angel.co/brian-wang,https://angel.co/nick-bhardwaj,https://angel.co/mike-edelhart,https://angel.co/bobawu","https://angel.co/william-lohse"
