Achievements

I&#x27;m a consumer software/hardware entrepreneur &amp; investor. My focus is on product development, design, and growth; at both the seed-stage (conduit, ambient) and growth companies (zynga, teamtalk). 

I&#x27;ve been building social internet companies since the late 90s when I designed a series of early internet communities around best selling books. Then spent the go-go &quot;.com&quot; days building an online sports media company internetsoccer.com, managing product, growth, and content as COO during the rapid rise, sale to Teamtalk, and subsequent IPO.

From there I relocated to Boston and was part of the early team at MIT Media Lab spinoff Ambient Devices, a pioneering &quot;internet of things&quot; company. Subsequently, I was Founder, CEO of Conduit Labs, backed by CRV and Prism and sold to Zynga after three years. I joined Zynga as GM, scaled Zynga Boston, launched Indiana Jones Adventure World, reaching 40m monthly users at peak, and recently left following the IPO to join Spark Capital.

Achievements

I am the founder of seed stage venture firm, Streamlined Ventures which is investing actively.  Over the last 18 years, I have invested in over 60 companies as an active angel investor, many of which have gone on to become significant successes.  My areas of interest range from Web 2.0, mobile web, enterprise computing and the infrastructure technologies underlying those spaces.

Until a couple of years ago, I was a senior partner and helped build Globespan Capital Partners, a leading venture capital firm.  There I led investments in over 15 companies and was an active member of their boards. In addition, I also helped my colleagues at the firm evaluate and invest in close to 150 other companies.

Prior to that I helped build FAC/Equities, a prominent investment banking and research boutique during the 1990s. During that time, I was named a Wall Street All Star by the Wall Street Journal and was recognized as one of the top research analysts on Wall Street by Fortune magazine.","Big Data,Bridging Online and Offline,Clean Technology,Cloud Computing,Consumer Internet,Data Security,Developer APIs,Developer Tools,Enterprise Security,Internet Infrastructure,Kids,Mobile,Mobile Commerce,SaaS,Sales and Marketing,Security,Social Media,Social Media Platforms,Video Games","Burlingame,Mountain View,Palo Alto,Redwood City,San Francisco,San Jose,San Mateo,Santa Clara CA,Silicon Valley,Sunnyvale","https://angel.co/streamlined-ventures","https://angel.co/globespan,https://angel.co/streamlined-ventures,https://angel.co/first-albany-corporation","https://angel.co/easypost,https://angel.co/clever,https://angel.co/ginzametrics,https://angel.co/rescale,https://angel.co/bullpen-capital,https://angel.co/virool,https://angel.co/bladelogic,https://angel.co/authy,https://angel.co/mattermark,https://angel.co/critical-path,https://angel.co/sandforce,https://angel.co/knotch,https://angel.co/pubnub,https://angel.co/trigger-io-1,https://angel.co/indinero,https://angel.co/addepar,https://angel.co/visually,https://angel.co/bitnami,https://angel.co/selligy,https://angel.co/doordash,https://angel.co/keen-io,https://angel.co/rolepoint,https://angel.co/runscope,https://angel.co/boomtrain,https://angel.co/intertrust,https://angel.co/upcounsel,https://angel.co/everest,https://angel.co/womply,https://angel.co/pirus-networks,https://angel.co/arbinet,https://angel.co/genomera,https://angel.co/irobot,https://angel.co/buildzoom,https://angel.co/zerply,https://angel.co/wevorce,https://angel.co/keen-systems,https://angel.co/compass-6,https://angel.co/airseed,https://angel.co/dygest,https://angel.co/bina-technologies,https://angel.co/nantero,https://angel.co/citus-data,https://angel.co/applovin,https://angel.co/onefold,https://angel.co/opengov,https://angel.co/zeachem,https://angel.co/tachyus,https://angel.co/sourcery,https://angel.co/virident-systems,https://angel.co/snapvolumes,https://angel.co/glasshouse-technologies,https://angel.co/bridgelux,https://angel.co/baarzo-2,https://angel.co/amiato,https://angel.co/filepicker-io-1,https://angel.co/feed-fm,https://angel.co/coskata,https://angel.co/iswifter,https://angel.co/resilinc,https://angel.co/atheer-labs,https://angel.co/sunlink,https://angel.co/tapintv,https://angel.co/calisolar,https://angel.co/mcube,https://angel.co/ark-com,https://angel.co/saffron-technology,https://angel.co/youplus",""

I have sourced, led, or co-led Highland’s investments in BetterLesson, Ink, Leap Motion, RentJuice (acquired by Zillow), Talaria Technologies (acquired by Google), and thredUP. I also supported Highland’s investments in Bit9, QD Vision, Rethink Robotics, and Vertica (acquired by HP). In addition, I led the Summer@Highland entrepreneurship program, which over its 6 year history has mentored more than 40 student-led startups from inception, including Cloudflare, Gemvara, and Wildfire (acquired by Google).

Prior to Highland, I studied physics at Harvard College (summa cum laude), materials engineering at MIT (thesis on optical materials synthesis and characterization), and business at Harvard Business School (Baker Scholar). I have published papers in Phys Rev B, Journal of Applied Physics, and IEEE Transactions on Magnetics.

I also worked at McKinsey &amp; Co. and RockPort Capital Partners and have represented San Francisco as an inaugural member of the World Economic Forum Global Shapers.","Analytics,Artificial Intelligence,Augmented Reality,B2B,Big Data,Business Intelligence,Cloud Computing,Collaboration,Consumer Internet,Data Mining,Deep Information Technology,Developer APIs,Developer Tools,Development Platforms,Education,Enterprise Software,Human Computer Interaction,Internet,Internet Infrastructure,Machine Learning,Marketplaces,Mobile,Mobile Enterprise,Mobile Search,Platforms,Real Estate,SaaS,Software","Berkeley,Fremont,Menlo Park,Mountain View,Palo Alto,Redwood City,San Francisco,San Jose,San Mateo,Santa Clara,Silicon Valley,Sunnyvale","","https://angel.co/highland-capital-partners,https://angel.co/mckinsey-company,https://angel.co/summer-highland","https://angel.co/rentjuice,https://angel.co/leap-motion,https://angel.co/betterlesson,https://angel.co/ideapaint,https://angel.co/bit9,https://angel.co/rethink-robotics,https://angel.co/2u,https://angel.co/vertica,https://angel.co/talaria,https://angel.co/qd-vision,https://angel.co/filepicker-io-1,https://angel.co/imprivata","https://angel.co/rethinkdb,https://angel.co/thredup"

Partner at Lux Capital, currently investing out of our 3rd fund ($245m) in technology, energy and healthcare sectors. Previously I was an investor at General Catalyst Partners and an entrepreneur. Spent 15 years in Boston and now in Palo Alto.



Achievements

I invest in founders and startups trying to solve important problems, from consumer/lifestyle companies to robotics, computational imaging, big data analytics, energy and healthcare IT.

I am not a momentum investor, but want to bet on big ideas that when they win, win big. I prefer technical teams that have depth of understanding of the space, and businesses that can truly differentiate themselves in the marketplace over the long term. I don&#x27;t let technology categories limit me, and hope to back explosive commercial success stories that also solve real problems in the world. 

I take special joy in helping and supporting first-time entrepreneurs. I also co-founded RoughDraft.vc and StartLabs.org to support student technical founders.

Achievements

I was hired to be the &quot;Engine Oil&quot; of Groupon Middle East during its set up. I enjoyed helping the CEO form a team and take care of admin and HR issues. 

I was in liaison with various Ministries in UAE to enable smooth operations of Groupon and was instrumental in ensuring company functions were set to the highest standard. 

At OScom, I was hired to develop substantial revenue streams that transcend the emerging market of Bangladeshi eCommerce. My team and I devised and launched one of the most innovative online advertising concepts in Bangladesh that grew traction fairly quickly. 

I formulated the launch of &quot;OScomBazar&quot; www.oscombazar.com, due to the market demand for an online store with variety of products. This amplified our growth substantially. I was also the original advocate of rolling out OScom across Bangladesh, where we saw a substantial spike in deliveries.

Achievements

We built Lefora from the ground up with the idea that forums should be easy to create with features that foster community building. I had my hand in many hats, including: fundraising, product spec, marketing, PR, social media, Search Engine Optimization (generating 30% of all traffic), &amp; sophisticated email retainment campaigns accounting for 15% of traffic.

I also had the fortune to take time off to spend one year travelling around Asia, immersing myself in new cultures. I spent 10 days driving an auto-rickshaw (tuk tuk) over 1,000km across India. I ventured 4,014km high to to tallest city in the world - Litang, China. I rocked out to Beijing underground hip hop, scooted around the island of Taiwan, and explored the jungles of Borneo and Laos! I was invited to personally join the Sultan of Yogakarta, Indonesia for a New Year&#x27;s festival. I took a 10 day vow of silence to learn Vipassana meditation, and spent 2 weeks living at a buddhist monastery, studying Kung Fu under Shaolin monks.

I started Five9.com at the height of the dot bust, competing with startups who had collectively raised over $100M and telco giants like Cisco and Avaya. Within one year of funding we were doing more in revenues than all the competing startups - combined. DoctorBase.com is completely self-funded and is approaching profitability. While our growth at DoctorBase.com has been organic thus far, our model has already attracted over 5,000 healthcare providers as users - a rare feat in Health 2.0.

I designed the specifications, managed the technology teams and lead the global conversion of 32 mammoth clients from sporadic manually intensive reporting system to one elegant database driven centralized risk reporting system - missing deadlines cost millions of dollars. I founded my own company The Crafty Rascal that was profitable in the second month.
I orchestrated the centralization of all Business Continuity Reporting to one centralized platform, allowing the business to understand level of threat preparedness globally. I advanced Rentricity a hydrokinetic energy startup to the top 1% of GE Ecomagination earning notice from top investors, and a commercial project with American Water. I selected 12 profound companies in the renewables space from amongst hundreds in Europe, while working at the CleantechGroup, to present to investors at the Paris conference. The conference enabled the startups access to investors and the boost needed to get to the next stage of growth.

Previously responsible for the redevelopment and relaunch of a enterprise healthcare information database (Pharmadeals), used by the majority of big pharma and biotech companies. Relaunch resulted in revitalised sales, leading to eventual acquisition by global healthcare information group, IMS Health.

Achievements

Because there&#x27;s no great place to put it otherwise, I feel I should state that Yapta and Elemental were companies I was a board observer for previously (AngelList merely says &quot;advisor,&quot; which is the closest, truthiest category I could choose.)  At Blue Box Group, I actually was an &quot;advisor.&quot;  At Lighter and Voyager, I was an investor, meaning that I deployed capital on their behalf; perhaps it should say &quot;Team Member&quot; (though at Lighter, I also put money into the company).  At AboutUs, I remain on the Board of Directors.

"Nicole Staple","Brideside","Silicon Valley Bank,Monitor Group,UBS Investment Bank","","","Spent a career in finance, and knew I had to build something of my own after working with early stage companies as a VC investor. I love everything outdoors and in my next life I will be a ski bum. You can find me eating Asian soups, teaching spin classes or maybe at an indie rock concert.



Achievements

Spent four years in investment banking and technology venture capital, working with companies in healthcare IT, hardware and consumer internet. While receiving my MBA at the Kellogg School of Management I worked tirelessly at recruiting top women to Kellogg and improving their experience. 

As an entrepreneur, I worked on and advised many early stage companies, ranging from a new tool for on-campus undergraduate recruiting in 2007 to a new type of gym to serve low-income communities in 2011. 

My most proud entrepreneurial venture was launching Chicago Year Up, which is a national nonprofit that seeks to close the Opportunity Divide by providing urban young adults with the skills, experience, and support that will empower them to reach their potential.

I started 10 years ago as digital helper for some DJs called Above &amp; Beyond and their label Anjunabeats. Over the years we&#x27;ve become the biggest independent record label in the world. Above &amp; Beyond reached 4 time the Top 5 DJ Poll and have now a community of 31 million people globally. Each of our releases reaches #1 position worldwide in the iTunes music store. I created a lot of social-driven web apps mainly for remote watching live-concerts and interact with the DJs. There is so much more I can tell you about. This has been the experience of my life and the thing I am the proudest to date. Lets meet ?!

To that end I am very critical of the team&#x27;s efforts early on, especially when deciding which problems are worth solving.  

On the execution side, most of what I like to do is focus on organization design and recruiting.

I have many relationships across enterprises and technology companies, mostly with product and technologists (CTO/Architects) and not as much necessarily the buyers (CEO/CIO). I look to make introductions for companies to understand whether their approach is valid, and not for the sake of a transaction.

I try to ask critical questions and prefer to put the decision back to the team.

"Cindy Engstrom","Is That Odd,Sircle Advertising","Sircle Advertising","Azure Capital Partners,MoonExpress","","Startup warrior. I love the intesection of consumer behavior and emerging technology.  I like big plays that impact an ecosystem.  I enjoy investing in smart people who see where the new opportunities lay.  I don&#x27;t do &quot;me too&quot; investing.  I&#x27;m ex Wildseed, ex @Mobile, ex retail start up and now on #4



Achievements

I define and market NEW exceptionally well.
@Mobile one of the first wireless app providers delivering content on a 2G handset. Acquired for $450mm.
Wildseed built the iphone with more features in 2002 (investor fatigue hurt launch chances).  Solid exit to AOL.  We built a linux based OS for a new phone (both CDMA and GSM), plus interactive accessories to drive data and retail engagement pre bandwidth.
Sircle Advertiisng is redefining how sampling can be done in the digital era.  
I have two patents and a couple pending.

His military leadership roles ranged from running a high-tech organization in Europe; to serving as an Aide de Camp to the Four Star General responsible for U.S. forces in Europe, Africa, and Afghanistan; to deploying with elite special operations teams worldwide, ensuring they were enabled by the world’s most advanced technologies.

"Kris Petersen","DealsGoRound,Morsel,Betterfly,NeighborHuddle","Lightbank,IBM,PwC","","Morsel","I taught myself to code when I was a kid because I loved it. I studied business in college because I thought I should. Now I use both.

I&#x27;ve been a founding CEO and CTO for two different venture-backed startups which have been acquired. Now I&#x27;m working on my third, @Morsel.



Achievements

I spent the first five years of my professional career as a supply chain consultant with IBM and PricewaterhouseCoopers. The next five years were spent as a Sr. Technical Analyst with GS1 US. All the while my mind was obsessed with building and doing my own things.

In 2010, I built @DealsGoRound in my kitchen working nights and weekends. A few months later, @Lightbank offered me a position as an EIR. Fast forward four years and I&#x27;ve built two companies which were acquired and now I&#x27;m starting @Morsel, which is a beautiful storytelling app for chefs, mixologists and sommeliers.

I&#x27;ve bootstrapped a company from 0-300 employees by frugal operations (no early investors, only very profitable sales &amp; operations), then raised VC, many M&amp;A, and IPO.

Achievements

Originally from Montreal, Ian spent four years of his career in Silicon Valley. In 2006, when he was VP of Marketing and Communications at Tiny Pictures, he helped launch Radar, the first mobile photo sharing social network, and grew it’s user base to over 1.5M users in less than a year.

Following the acquisition of Tiny Pictures by Shutterfly, Ian became Director of Marketing of its mobile and social media team. There he launched Wink, a mobile app that lets users create photobooth-style prints directly from their iPhone.

Ian started his career in 2002 as half of the two-man team behind Nomad, Cossette Communications Street Intelligence Agency. There he pioneered non-traditional marketing techniques in word-of-mouth and insight generation. Nike, Coca-Cola and McDonald’s were among Nomad&#x27;s major clients.
